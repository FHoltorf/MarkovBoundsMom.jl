## MarkovBounds.jl

MarkovBounds.jl is a meta-package to simplify the use of moment bounding schemes for the analysis of jump-diffusion processes with polynomial data via convex optimization. 
Such moment bounding schemes enable the computation of *hard, theoretically guaranteed* bounds on moments and many related statistics associated with jump diffusion processes.
